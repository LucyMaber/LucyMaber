âš¡ Fun fact:
Iâ€™m a huge fan of video games like Splatoon and Mario Kartâ€”great ways to unwind after a day of coding! I also love Star Trek and Doctor Who and believe that the ideas from these shows can inspire innovative approaches to shaping modern policy and technology. Thereâ€™s so much we can learn from the future they imagine!
